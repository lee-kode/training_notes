# Random PSM-1 Notes

## Product Backlog Refinement
* If multiple teams are working on the project, they will participate in the refinement as well. 
* Refinement can take any amount of time from the Product Owner
* Not more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. 
* Refinement is a continuous activity not limited to a certain time during the Sprint. 
* The Scrum Master only facilitates the meetings as requested or required; not by default.

## Definition of Done
* Which event is the most appropriate for discussing or updating the definition of "Done"? During Sprint Retrospective.
* The Development Team owns the DoD (Definition of Done).
* 

## Random Topics
* The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog and the Product Owner owns the Product Backlog.
* The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog
* The Development Team owns the DoD (Definition of Done).
* The Product Owner owns the Product Backlog.

* Gantt Chart is not a Scrum artifact and not compatible with the framework.

* **It is forecasted that the project will be over in 4 Sprints. The Product Owner wants to design acceptance tests for all items. What's the best response from the Scrum Master?** It is _not_ necessary. Scrum doesn't use upfront planning and design and what's described in this question is a form of upfront preparation.

* **Scrum is a lightweight development methodology?** FALSE. Scrum is referred to as a "framework" rather than a "methodology".

* **Which of the following are optional in Scrum? (choose 2 answers)** - Velocity and Release Plan

* Designing the software is part of the development and should be done by the developers. They are self-organized and make technical decisions and volunteer for tasks (assign them to themselves). Estimation is the responsibility of the developers because they are the people who will develop the item.

* **When is it time for integrating the solution?** During the Sprint. Integration is part of the development of each item and a step in a normal definition of "Done". Agile projects use continuous integration to make the output potentially releasable.

* **The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work the _DEVELOPMENT TEAM_ identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal.** This is up to the developers to identify how to accomplish the goal. After all, they are the technical people in the project.The question is about the Sprint Backlog tasks, rather than items.

* **Who monitors the remaining work of the Product Backlog?** The _Product Owner_ is responsible for measuring the progress of the project and tracking the remaining work in the Product Backlog.The Development Team is responsible for measuring the progress of the Sprint and tracking the remaining work in the Sprint Backlog.

* **Who can change the Sprint Backlog in the middle of the Sprint?** _The Development Team._ The Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint do not change but the Sprint Backlog also contains tasks and tasks evolve through the Sprint. The Development Team owns the Sprint Backlog and only they can change the Sprint Backlog. This is sometimes done based on the input from the Product Owner.

* **Which of the following is a prerequisite for starting the Sprint Planning meeting?** _None._ We prefer to have "ready" items at the top of the Product Backlog before Sprint Planning, which is done through Product Backlog refinement. However, nothing stops our flow of Sprints. For example, we do not delay the Sprint because the items are not ready. In such cases, the "unready" items would be selected for the Sprint and refined during the Sprint."Ready" items are those that are clear and small enough to fit into one Sprint.

* **Velocity** - the average amount of work done per Sprint

* When there's one product, there should be only one Product Owner, even if the product is large and there are many Development Teams. However, when there are multiple products, there are two options:a) considering them separate and have a Product Owner for each of themb) have only one Product Owner for all of them and develop them like a larger project to ensure compatibility.

* Velocity is defined locally and it's not possible to compare one team's velocity with the other.

* Burn-down charts are very common for tracking and representing progress, but they are not mandatory and the Product Owner can use other tools/techniques as well.

* The definition of "Done" can be prepared in the development organization and used in all projects as a minimum. If additional content is required for the definition or it's not prepared in the organization level, the Development Team would be responsible for preparing it.The definition of "Done" can evolve during the project as more is learned. It's also dependent on the project and its environment.

* **When multiple teams are working on the same product, who should make sure that their outputs can be integrated into one Increment?** The developers. It's up to the developers to find their way and ensure that their outputs will create an integrated Increment that is potentially releasable.

* The Sprint Retrospective happens after the Sprint Review; it's the last event in the Sprint. It's three hours in a one-month Sprint and all Scrum Team members attend it.Its purpose is planning for improvements in the process (the way we're working), but it's not the only time we try to improve.Similar to Sprint Planning, Sprint Review and Daily Scrum, it's an opportunity for inspection and adaptation.

* **What's the optimal length of a Sprint?** Short enough to minimize risk. We prefer shorter Sprints as long as we can produce enough output. Shorter Sprints reduce the risk to the business.

* **The Product Owner is responsible for the definition of "Done"?** FALSE. If there's a definition of "Done" in the development organization that would be used for all projects. Otherwise, the Development Team would be responsible for creating one.Even when there's a definition of "Done" in the organization, it can be used as a minimum and the developer can add extra elements to it (eg to decrease technical debt).

* **The scope may be re-negotiated as more is learned?** TRUE. During the Sprint, the Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog would not be added or removed but as more is learned, the scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team. This is mainly focused on the interpretation of the Product Backlog items and the tasks created by decomposing them.

* **The Product Owner is responsible for preparing the Sprint Goal before the Sprint Planning?** FALSE. The Sprint Goal is prepared during the Sprint Planning by the whole Scrum Team.

* **All interactions between the stakeholders and the Development Team should be through the Product Owner?** FALSE. The interactions can be through the Product Owner or during the Sprint Review. Other interactions are discouraged as they distract the developers.

* **Hardening Sprints are not allowed** because the subject of hardening should be continuously address throughout normal Sprints. All Sprints are the same in Scrum. Other options are not described in the framework but are good practices recommended for Scrum projects.

* **We don't baseline any artifact in Scrum.** The Sprint Backlog is dynamic and changes during the Sprint to include newly identified tasks.

* Unlike methodologies, **the Scrum "framework" is not tailored** because it's already limited to the essentials. Even the terms should not change let along adding or removing elements such as roles and events. However, you need to add many practices and techniques to the framework.

* Velocity and value are not related directly. Value is the benefit to cost ratio. Since we start with the most important items first, those remained for the 11th Sprint are expected to have less value compared to those delivered at the 6th Sprint.

* **Which of the following roles can set the definition of "Done"?** The Development Team. The development organization may have a definition of "Done" composed for all projects in which case the team will use it as a minimum. Otherwise, the Development Team would be responsible for composing the definition of "Done". When multiple teams are working on the same product, there can be more than one definition of "Done", as long as they all have the minimums required by the development organization and can create an integrated Increment.

* **Product Backlog refinement is a continuous activity.** When an item is at the top of the backlog, which means it will be developed in the near future, more refinements are usually needed to make sure it is clear and contains just enough details (not all possible details). It's preferred to have the items that will be selected in the Sprint Backlog completely refined before Sprint Planning; however, it's OK to have more refinement done during the development. Remember that there's no such thing as Sprint 0 and there's no time between two Sprints that can be spent on something such as refinement. The team is also cross-functional and does the a-z of the work needed for each item, including refinement; they don't use people from other parts of the company.

* **Items are "Done" when they are complete based on the definition of "Done".** In that case, they would have the potential of creating a releasable/shippable Increment that is usable by the end user. Tests are also part of the work and items are not "Done" before the tests are complete; even the user acceptance tests. Quality requirements are part of the work but not all of it (eg non-functional features and development processes are also part of the work). We cannot trust the identified tasks because we might have missed some tasks and the sum of them do not conform to the definition of "Done".

* **Which of the following is designed to synchronize multiple teams working on the same product?** Scrum-of-Scrums. Daily Scrum is for synchronizing inside a team and Scrum-of-Scrums is for synchronizing multiple teams working on the same product. When the Daily Scrum is over, one representative from each team goes to a higher level daily stand-up to discuss the issues among teams. Note: scrum.org has recently introduced its scaled Scrum framework called Nexus. It doesn't have a scrum-of-scrum as described here, while there might still be some questions about it in the exam.

* **Only the Product Owner can cancel a Sprint** and the final decision belongs to him/her. However, this decision can be influenced by the customer, developers and Scrum Master.

* **The Sprint Review is the only time when stakeholder feedback is captured?** FALSE. The Sprint Review is probably the most important opportunity for capturing feedback but adaptation is not limited to that. The Product Owner is constantly in contact with the stakeholders to identify new Product Backlog items or to refine them.

* **Conflict should be avoided at all cost on Agile teams?** FALSE. Managed conflicts can be helpful to the project.

* **When multiple Scrum teams are working on the same product, should all of their outputs be integrated every Sprint?** Yes. All teams start and finish the Sprint within their defined timeboxes and their outputs would be combined and create an integrated Increment.

* **Describe Transparency** Transparency is about visibility and doesn't contain understanding; even though we'd better try our best to create the right understanding too but that's another story. The "whole process" might be too much for some stakeholders; "significant aspects" is enough, as we treat most things in Agile environments.

* **The Product Owner and Scrum Master should not be part of the Development Team?** - FALSE. It's OK for one person to have more than one of the three Scrum roles even though it's not recommended. eg Product Owner and developer. Note: when we say that a sentence like this is false, it means that the opposite is right. However, remember that the opposite of "should not" is "may" rather than "should".

* No extra roles and titles are recognized in Scrum because it blocks self-organization, collaboration and accountability.

* **Who creates the Sprint Goal?** The Scrum Team. All Scrum Team members together compose the Sprint Goal during the Sprint Planning.

* Performance, like security, scalability and maintainability is a non-functional feature. Non-functional features are normally added to the definition of "Done" because they apply to all functional features. For some non-functional features, such as performance, it's possible to create non-technical, independent items in the Product Backlog. This is usually done when we have to make an improvement in the previously done features.

* All teams can use the same definition of "Done" but if required they can have different definitions as long as they are compatible and capable of creating integrated Increments. The answer to this question would have been "true" instead of "false" if there was a "may" instead of "should".

* **What happens when the Product Backlog is not clear enough at Sprint Planning?** Nothing. The sprint would be planned anyway. We prefer to have "ready" items at the top of the Product Backlog before Sprint Planning, which is done through Product Backlog refinement. However, nothing stops our flow of Sprints, for example, we do not delay the Sprint because the items are not ready. In such cases, the "unready" items would be selected for the Sprint anyway and refined during the Sprint. "Ready" items are those that are clear and small enough to fit into one Sprint.

* **It's required to use user stories in Scrum?** FALSE. It's a good idea to use user stories for describing the Product Backlog items but it's not required.

* **If it's not possible to complete the Sprint Backlog, who would try to resolve it?** _The Development Team and the Product Owner_

* **The Product Owner is responsible for preparing the Sprint Goal before the Sprint Planning?** FALSE. The Sprint Goal is prepared during the Sprint Planning by the _whole Scrum Team._

* **A Sprint is considered successful when an increment is released to production?** FALSE.

* **Using Scrum ensures that all resources on a project will be utilised in the most efficient way?** FALSE.
* **When multiple Scrum teams are working on the same product, should all of their outputs be integrated every Sprint?** YES.

* **Which of the following best describes transparency?** "significant aspects" 

* **Each Development Team member should be cross-functional.** FALSE. The entire development team as a whole should be cross-functional. Not every single member has to be.

* **Who supports the Scrum Master in removing impediments?** The development team + Senior management.

* **When should Increments be shipped?** When it makes sense.

* End-users are the most important stakeholders.
