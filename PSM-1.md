_PSM-1 Exam Prep notes by Lee Engel <lee@kode.co.za>_

# Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and interactions over process and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Respond to change over following a plan

## Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools
* Process and tools are required but individuals and interactions are most important
* Projects are completed by humans and not tools
* Agile projects are "people driven"
* It's all about relationships

## Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
* _Value_ is in working software
* Agile projects need to deliver _value_
* _Value_ is about a business need to deliver
* Documentation should be _barely sufficient_
* Documentation is delivered in a **JIT** fashion (just in time)
* Documentation is delivered at the _last responsible moment_

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Agile is _flexible, accomodating, willing to change_
* Being right vs doing the right thing
* The right thing: _deliver value_

## Responding to change over Following a plan
* Agile welcomes _change_
* Agile projects have lots of _change_
* Agile projects have _uncertainty_ upfront.

# Characteristics of a Scrum project
* Scope is not clearly defined
* A product will emerge
* Changing requirements
* Requirements will emerge over time
* Activies are vague
* Cost and time estimate are challenging
* Processes are iterative
* New work depends on previous work
* Customer satisfaction equates to success
* Increments create _usable value_

# When to use Scrum
* Many _unknowns_
* Complex projects with _difficult to define detailed requirements_
* Don't apply scrum if the organistion is not ready
* _Training_ is required for all Scrum participants

# Scrum Basics
* _Framework_ for complex adaptive problems
* Lightweight
* Simple to understand but difficult to maste
* Evolved since the '90s
* _Framework_ for proccesses (and not a process itself)
* Characteristics of _product management_ (not just project management)
* Rules and roles are what you need to know. **NB!!**

## Scrum Utilisations
* Scrum can be used in many disciplines
* Goal is to create working software so it's not just to do coding - It's to **create value**
* Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
* Develop products and enhancements
* Frequently release products and enhancements
* Develop and sustain cloud and operations for product use
* Sustain and renew products

## Scrum Theory
* Empirical: based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.
* Empiricism: the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses.
* Knowledge comes from experience _and_ making decision based on what is known.
* Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk

## Notes on theory
* Sprint: an iteration
* Defects go into the _backlog_
* Risks threaten value
* Sprint backlog vs product backlog ...????

## Three Scrum Pillars: TIA
* **T**ransparency
  * Common standard
  * Common understanding
  * Common language
  * Common DOD (Definition of Done)
* **I**spection
  * Frequently inspect Scrum artefacts and progress
  * Inspection should not get in the way of work
  * Most beneficial if performed by skilled inspectors
* **A**daption
  * If the resulting product is unaccceptable, the process must be adjusted.
  * Adjustments are made ASAP.
  * Scrum events for inspection and adaption (4 ceremonies):
    * Sprint planning
    * Daily scrum
    * Sprint review
    * Sprint retrospective

# Terminology
* **Product Backlog** is a list of requirements that the product owner will prioritise with the dev team.
  * All the things that the project can have. Prioritised from most to least important.
  * Functional and non-functional requirements.
  * Non-functional requirements: stability, security, uptime. Things you can't touch/feel.
  * Architecture
  * Items in the backlog can be assigned _"points"_ (used for sizing).
  * Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Development Team to determine what it should work on.
  * All Sprint Backlog Items are "owned" by the entire Development Team, even though each one may be implemented by an individual development team member.
* **Product Owner** - The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.
  * The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog, which includes that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.
  * represents the customer and key stakeholders (the business)
  * Prepares the product roadmap
  * Prepares the user stories
* **Sprint** - iteration or increment (usually 4 weeks)
  * The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. This applies to every Sprint.
  * The duration of a Sprint is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. Ideally 4 weeks.
  * During the Sprint, scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.
  * The Development Team is responsible for managing the progress of the sprint.
  * During **all** sprints the dev team must:
    * Deliver an increment of potentially releasable software.
    * Develop and deliver at least one piece of functionality.
* **Sprint backlog** - Tasks required for a user story. List of things to accomplish in the sprint.
* **User stories** - describes requirements. comes from the customer's requirements. Prepared by the product owner.
* **Daily Scrum** - 15 minutes. Dev team only. Three questions: 
  * What was worked on yesterday? 
  * What is being worked on today?
  * what impediments do we have?
* **Product increment** - The results of the sprint.
  * Scrum requires an Increment to be releasable. This is an Increment of product. 
  * Many teams working on a single product are expected to deliver such an Increment.
  * The product increment should be usable and releasable at the end of every Sprint, but it does not have to be released.
* **Sprint review** - A demonstration of what has been created in the sprint.
  * Sprint review length: 4 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.
* **Scrum Master** - A Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Development Team. Facilitation and removing impediments serves a team in achieving the best productivity possible.
  * The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. 
  * The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box. 
  * The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.
  * Makes sure the scrum processes is followed intirely and _offer coaching_.
* **Scrum Team** - The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
* **Time-box** - Time-boxed events are events that have a _maximum_ duration.
* **Daily Scrum** - The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.

# Scrum Timeline

## Pre-sprint Activities
* Vision Statement - Concise description of the goals of the project
* Product Roadmap - Visual timeline of major product features to be delivered. Usually prepared by the Product Owner
* Stories - Requirements prepared by the Product Owner from the customer's requirements
* Product Backlog - A prioritised list of stories

## Sprint Activities
* Sprint Planning Meeting
  * Plan what goes into the sprint
  * Product Owner _prioritises_ requirements and decides on Sprint Backlog contents
  * Stories make up the Sprint Backlog
  * The team breaks down stories into _tasks_
* Team takes ~30 days to deliver the agreed amount of stories
* Daily Scrum is _15_ minutes
* Sprint Demo: completed stories are demonstrated to the customer by Sprint Review team.
* Sprint Retrospective: the Sprint is reviewed the Sprint team for improvements (lessons learned)
* Sprint Review and Retrospective are held _during_ the Sprint
* A new Sprint starts _immediately_ after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

## Sprint Duration
* Risk of being disconnected from stakeholders
* Ability to go to market with product release
* Frequency that team composition can be changed
* All sprints should be the same duration
* No such thing as "Sprint Zero"

## Sprint Ceremonies
* Sprint Planning Meeting:
  * Time-box: **8 hours** for 4-week sprint
  * Attendees: Entire scrum team (product owner, scrum master, dev team)
  * Goal: Dev team capacity. Definition of Done. Sprint backlog.
* Daily Scrum:
  * Time-box: **15 minute** stand-up
  * Attendees: Dev team
  * Goal: Progress. Impediments.
* Sprint Review Meeting:
  * Time-box: **4 hours** for 4-week sprint
  * Attendees: Complete scrum team and stakeholders
  * Goal: Demo project work and assess feedback
  * Notes: The _team_ does the demo (not the scrum master)
* Sprint Retrospective:
  * Time-box: **3 hours** for a 4-week sprint
  * Attendees: Complete scrum team
  * Goal: Brainstorm and agree on what's working and what is not.
  
# Scrum Team
* Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team members.
* No other roles than 3 mentioned.
* There is no "project manager" role. Those responsibilities are shared.
* Team is self-organised. Manages own efforts.
* Scrum master does _not_ manage the team.
* Cross-functional - team members can typically do more than one role.
* Remove items if work is too much/large or recruit more team members.
* Customers and users are _stakeholders_

## Product Owner
* Respresents the business, cusotmers, end-users, etc.
* Value optimizer
* This role is for 1 person only.
* May represent a committee.
* Well versed in the business.
* One product owner for the entire project
* One product backlog for the entire project
* Product owner can cancel a sprint (not the dev team).
* Responsible for the Product Backlog
  * User stories must be easy to understand.
  * Communicates with customers to keep backlog updated.
  * Measures performance of the project
  * Forecasts completion date
  * Responsible for prioritising backlog
* Entire org should respect the Product Owner's decisions
* Nobody should try to override the Product Owner's decisions
* Nobody should try to instruct the development team directly
* Product Owner might delegate some responsibilities but stays accountable.

## Scrum Master
* Fully understands "Scrum"
* Coaches the team to ensure that all processes are implemented.
* Scrum Master is a management position which manages the Scrum process but not the Scrum team.
* Servant-leader of the scrum team.
* Leads the org in their efforts to adopt Scrum.
* Removes impediments to the Dev Team.
* Facilitates events
* Train/coach the team
* Helps Product Owner by consulting, communicating and facilitating.
* Helps those outside the team understand the appropriate interactions with the team
* Scrum Master should not be part of the dev team.
* Acts as a shield for the team.
* Can remove team members that are causing conflict.
* Keep stakeholders abiding the rules.
* Serious Impediments;
  * Alert management to the impediments and their impact
  * Consult with Dev Team
  * Prioritise the impediments list and address each in order
* Scrum Master and Product Owner work together

## Development Team
* _Experts_ that are responsible for delivering the backlog items and managing their efforts
* Should have the skills to turn the Product Backlog into an increment of potentially releasable product functionality.
* Cross-functional. Self-organised.
* The entire Development Team is responsible and accountable. No individual owns any task.
* Development Team delivers the final product of the project in increments (Sprints) as per the Product Backlog.
* Work full-time on a single project.
* Development Team members should not change often (escpecially during a Sprint).
* Scrum is effective for a 3 to 9 member dev team.
* Responsible for estimating items

### Self-organising Development Team
* Boost to creativity
* Team and project committment
* Accuracy of estimates
* New teams starting a project:
  * Scrum master to ensure the team understands the rules of Scrum and the DoD (definition of done)
  * Each team member introduce themselves and give brief background of the skills and work history
  * Product Owner discusses the project, product, history, goals and context. Answers any quetions.

### Development Team Considerations
* Bring the team together and let them self-organise
* Existing teams can decide how they want to self-organise
* Multiple Scrum Teams:
  * Large projects can use a scaled model
  * Multiple scrum teams are _not_ common
  * Adding new teams won't affect current productivity
  * Teams should be self-forming based on Vision and Scrum rules
  * All teams need a _common_ Defition of Done (DoD)
  * All teams should have same Sprint start date
  * 1 Prouct Owner and 1 Product Backlog
  
### Definition of Done
* Development team should deliver additional _features_ in a _useable_ state that _compliment_ those delivered in previous iterations.
* You cannot break what has already been done.
* If the team _can't_ finish all Spring Backlog items:
  * They do not include the items in the current Spring increment
  * They do not show it in the Sprint Review
  * Must be returned to the Product Backlog for the Product Owner to decide what to do
