# Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and interactions over process and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Respond to change over following a plan

## Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools
* Process and tools are required but individuals and interactions are most important
* Projects are completed by humans and not tools
* Agile projects are "people driven"
* It's all about relationships

## Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
* _Value_ is in working software
* Agile projects need to deliver _value_
* _Value_ is about a business need to deliver
* Documentation should be _barely sufficient_
* Documentation is delivered in a **JIT** (just in time)
* Documentation is delivered at the _last responsible moment_

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Agile is _flexible, accomodating, willing to change_
* Being right vs doing the right thing
* The right thing: _deliver value_

## Responding to change over Following a plan
* Agile welcomes _change_
* Agile projects have lots of _change_
* Agile projects have _uncertainty_ upfront.

# Characteristics of a Scrum project
* Scope is not clearly defined
* A product will emerge
* Changing requirements
* Requirements will emerge over time
* Activies are vague
* Cost and time estimate are challenging
* Processes are iterative
* New work depends on previous work
* Customer satisfaction equates to success
* Increments create _usable value_

# When to use Scrum
* Many _unknowns_
* Complex projects with _difficult to define detailed requirements_
* Don't apply scrum if the organistion is not ready
* _Training_ is required for all Scrum participants

# Scrum Basics
* _Framework_ for complex adaptive problems
* Lightweight
* Simple to understand but difficult to maste
* Evolved since the '90s
* _Framework_ for proccesses (and not a process itself)
* Characteristics of _product management_ (not just project management)
* Rules and roles are what you need to know. **NB!!**

## Scrum Utilisations
* Scrum can be used in many disciplines
* Goal is to create working software so it's not just to do coding - It's to **create value**
* Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
* Develop products and enhancements
* Frequently release products and enhancements
* Develop and sustain cloud and operations for product use
* Sustain and renew products

## Scrum Theory
* Empirical: based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.
* Empiricism: the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses.
* Knowledge comes from experience _and_ making decision based on what is known.
* Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk

## Notes on theory
* Sprint: an iteration
* Defects go into the _backlog_
* Risks threaten value
* Sprint backlog vs product backlog ...????

## Three Scrum Pillars: TIA
* **T**ransparency
  * Common standard
  * Common understanding
  * Common language
  * Common DOD (Definition of Done)
* **I**spection
  * Frequently inspect Scrum artefacts and progress
  * Inspection should not get in the way of work
  * Most beneficial if performed by skilled inspectors
* **A**daption
  * If the resulting product is unaccceptable, the process must be adjusted.
  * Adjustments are made ASAP.
  * Scrum events for inspection and adaption (4 ceremonies):
    * Sprint planning
    * Daily scrum
    * Sprint review
    * Sprint retrospective

# Scrum Timeline

## Terminology
* **Product Backlog** is a list of requirements that the product owner will prioritise with the dev team.
  * All the things that the project can have. Prioritised from most to least important.
  * Functional and non-functional requirements.
  * Non-functional requirements: stability, security, uptime. Things you can't touch/feel.
  * Architecture
  * Items in the backlog can be assigned _"points"_ (used for sizing).
  * Products have one Product Backlog, regardless of how many teams are used. Any other setup makes it difficult for the Development Team to determine what it should work on.
  * All Sprint Backlog Items are "owned" by the entire Development Team, even though each one may be implemented by an individual development team member.
* **Product Owner** - The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.
  * The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog, which includes that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.
  * represents the customer and key stakeholders (the business)
  * Prepares the product roadmap
  * Prepares the user stories

* **Sprint** - iteration or increment (usually four weeks)
  * The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. This applies to every Sprint
  * The duration of a Sprint is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened.
  * During the Sprint, scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.
  * The Development Team is responsible for managing the progress of the sprint.
  * During **all** sprints the dev team must:
    * Deliver an increment of potentially releasable software.
    * Develop and deliver at least one piece of functionality.
* **Sprint backlog** - Tasks required for a user story. List of things to accomplish in the sprint.
* **User stories** - describes requirements. comes from the customer's requirements. Prepared by the product owner.
* **Daily Scrum** - What was worked on yesterday. What is being worked on today and what impediments we have.
* **Product increment** - The results of the sprint.
  * Scrum requires an Increment to be releasable. This is an Increment of product. 
  * Many teams working on a single product are expected to deliver such an Increment.
  * The product increment should be usable and releasable at the end of every Sprint, but it does not have to be released.
* **Sprint review** - A demonstration of what has been created in the sprint.
  * Sprint review length: 4 hours for a monthly Sprint. For shorter Sprints it is usually shorter.
* **Scrum Master** - A Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Development Team. Facilitation and removing impediments serves a team in achieving the best productivity possible.
  * The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. 
  * The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box. 
  * The Scrum Master enforces the rule that only Development Team members participate in the Daily Scrum.
* **Scrum Team** - The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master.
* **Time-box** - Time-boxed events are events that have a maximum duration.
* **Daily Scrum** - The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.

## Pre-sprint Activies
* Vision Statement - Concise description of the goals of the project
* Product Roadmap - Visual timeline of major product features to be delivered. Usually prepared by the Product Owner
* Stories - Requirements prepared by the Product Owner from the customer's requirements
* Product Backlog - A prioritised list of stories
