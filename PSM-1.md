# Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and interactions over process and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Respond to change over following a plan

## Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools
* Process and tools are required but individuals and interactions are most important
* Projects are completed by humans and not tools
* Agile projects are "people driven"
* It's all about relationships

## Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
* _Value_ is in working software
* Agile projects need to deliver _value_
* _Value_ is about a business need to deliver
* Documentation should be _barely sufficient_
* Documentation is delivered in a **JIT** (just in time)
* Documentation is delivered at the _last responsible moment_

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Agile is _flexible, accomodating, willing to change_
* Being right vs doing the right thing
* The right thing: _deliver value_

## Responding to change over Following a plan
* Agile welcomes _change_
* Agile projects have lots of _change_
* Agile projects have _uncertainty_ upfront.

# Characteristics of a Scrum project
* Scope is not clearly defined
* A product will emerge
* Changing requirements
* Requirements will emerge over time
* Activies are vague
* Cost and time estimate are challenging
* Processes are iterative
* New work depends on previous work
* Customer satisfaction equates to success
* Increments create _usable value_

# When to use Scrum
* Many _unknowns_
* Complex projects with _difficult to define detailed requirements_
* Don't apply scrum if the organistion is not ready
* _Training_ is required for all Scrum participants

# Scrum Basics
* _Framework_ for complex adaptive problems
* Lightweight
* Simple to understand but difficult to maste
* Evolved since the '90s
* _Framework_ for proccesses (and not a process itself)
* Characteristics of _product management_ (not just project management)
* Rules and roles are what you need to know. **NB!!**

## Scrum Utilisations
* Scrum can be used in many disciplines
* Goal is to create working software so it's not just to do coding - It's to **create value**
* Research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
* Develop products and enhancements
* Frequently release products and enhancements
* Develop and sustain cloud and operations for product use
* Sustain and renew products

## Scrum Theory
* Empirical: based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic.
* Empiricism: the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses.
* Knowledge comes from experience _and_ making decision based on what is known.
* Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk

## Notes on theory
* Sprint: an iteration
* Defects go into the _backlog_
* Risks threaten value
* Sprint backlog vs product backlog ...????

## Three Scrum Pillars: TIA
* **T**ransparency
  * Common standard
  * Common understanding
  * Common language
  * Common DOD (Definition of Done)
* **I**spection
  * Frequently inspect Scrum artefacts and progress
  * Inspection should not get in the way of work
  * Most beneficial if performed by skilled inspectors
* **A**daption
  * If the resulting product is unaccceptable, the process must be adjusted.
  * Adjustments are made ASAP.
  * Scrum events for inspection and adaption (4 ceremonies):
    * Sprint planning
    * Daily scrum
    * Sprint review
    * Sprint retrospective
