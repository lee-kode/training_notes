## Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools
* Process and tools are required but individuals and interactions are most important
* Projects are completed by humans and not tools
* Agile projects are "people driven"
* It's all about relationships

## Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
* _Value_ is in working software
* Agile projects need to deliver _value_
* _Value_ is about a business need to deliver
* Documentation should be _barely sufficient_
* Documentation is delivered in a **JIT** (just in time)
* Documentation is delivered at the _last responsible moment_

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Agile is _flexible, accomodating, willing to change_
* Being right vs doing the right thing
* The right thing: _deliver value_

## Responding to change over Following a plan
* Agile welcomes _change_
* Agile projects have lots of _change_
* Agile projects have _uncertainty_ upfront.

# Characteristics of a Scrum project
* Scope is not clearly defined
* A product will emerge
* Changing requirements
* Requirements will emerge over time
* Activies are vague
* Cost and time estimate are challenging
* Processes are iterative
* New work depends on previous work
* Customer satisfaction equates to success
* Increments create _usable value_
